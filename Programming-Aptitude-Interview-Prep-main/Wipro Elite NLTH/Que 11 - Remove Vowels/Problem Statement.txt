Remove Vowels from a String 
In this article we will learn how to code a Java program to remove vowels from a string. ‘A’, ‘E’, ‘I’, ‘O’, ‘U’ are five vowels out of 26 characters in English alphabet letters. Java programming is case sensitive, and hence lowercase and uppercase characters are considered differently, so we will have to check for both the cases and then we can remove the vowels from a string
