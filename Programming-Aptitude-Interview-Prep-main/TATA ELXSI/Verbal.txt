Reading Comprehension:



Directions for questions 11 to 15 - Read the short passage below and answer the questions that follow:



A sanctuary may be defined as a place where Man is passive and the rest of Nature active. Till quite recently Nature had her own sanctuaries, where man either did not go at all or only as a tool-using animal in comparatively small numbers. But now, in this machinery age, there is no place left where man cannot go with overwhelming forces at his command. He can strangle to death all the nobler wildlife in the world today. To-morrow he certainly will have done so, unless he exercises due foresight and self-control in the meantime.

There is not the slightest doubt that birds and mammals are now being killed off much faster than they can breed. And it is always the largest and noblest forms of life that suffer the most. The whales and elephants, lions and eagles, go. The rats and flies and all mean parasites remain. This is inevitable in certain cases. But it is wanton killing off that I am speaking of to-night.



Civilized man begins by destroying the very forms of wildlife he learns to appreciate most when he becomes still more civilized. The obvious remedy is to begin conservation at an earlier stage, when it is easier and better in every way, by enforcing laws for close seasons, game preserves, the selective protection of certain species, and sanctuaries.

I have just defined a sanctuary as a place where man is passive and the rest of Nature active. But this general definition is too absolute for any special case. The mere fact that man has to protect a sanctuary does away with his purely passive attitude. Then, he can be beneficially active by destroying pests and parasites, like bot-flies or mosquitoes, and by finding antidotes for diseases like the epidemic which periodically kills off the rabbits and thus starves many of the carnivora to death. But, except in cases where the experiment has proved his intervention to be beneficial, the less he upsets the balance of Nature the better, even when he tries to be an earthly Providence.



11) The author implies that his first definition of a sanctuary is:

A) Totally wrong

B) Somewhat idealistic

C) unhelpful

D) indefensible

E) immutable



Your Answer Options:

1) A

2) B

3) C

4) D

5) E

Ans: Option 2



Explanation:

The author says in sentence two that his previous definition was too absolute. Yet he admits that the less man upsets the balance of Nature the better. Hence his definition is not entirely right (because it is too idealistic) but it is not entirely wrong either. It is now easy to eliminate answers A, C, D, and E because they are strongly negative.



12) The authors argument that destroying bot-flies and mosquitoes would be a beneficial action is most weakened by all of the following except

A) parasites have an important role to play in the regulation of populations

B) the elimination of any species can have unpredictable effects on the balance of nature

C) the pests themselves are part of the food chain

D) these insects have been introduced to the area by human activities

E) elimination of these insects would require the use of insecticides that kill a wide range of insects



Your Answer Options:

1) B

2) C & D

3) A

4) D

5) E

Ans: Option 4



Explanation:

In except questions find the true statements first. In this case, find four statements that weaken the idea that destroying pests is beneficial. That means finding statements that show that it is not a good idea to destroy the pests. Answers A, B, C, and E give reasons why destroying these insects might be a mistake. D, however, is the right answer because it suggests that eliminating these insects might not be wrong since they are not even natural inhabitants of the area.



13) It can be inferred that the passage is:

a) part of an article in a scientific journal

b) extracted from the minutes of a nature club

c) part of a speech delivered to an educated audience

d) a speech delivered in a court of law

e) from a polemical article published in a magazine







Your Answer Options:

1) D & E

2) A

3) C

4) B

5) D

Ans: Option 3



Explanation:

From the words I am speaking of tonight we can infer that the words were delivered orally, and not during theday time. The only possible answer is C.



14) What should be the most appropriate central idea of this passage:

A) The author argues that man kills big animals but saves mosquitoes & other parasites.

B) Man is selfish by nature so he is up against the wildlife which is harmful for his survival

C) Ecological balance, if not maintained by man will be harmful in long run.

D) Author proposes a programme for not disturbing the balance of nature as it is beneficial for mankind.

E) In view of the author,man should not intervene in natural environments.



Your Answer Options

1) A

2) D

3) C

4) E

5) B

Ans: Option 3



Explanation:

The author in his last paragraph warns the man against his attitude and suggests not to create disturbance in the ecological system and should have foresight for his own benefit.



15)Tone of the Author as expressed in the passage can be best described

A) Descriptive to analytical

B) Sarcastically humorous

C) Objective to narrative

D) Sarcastically critical to suggestive

E) Ironically sarcastic to negative



Your Answer Options

1) A

2) C

3) D

4) E

5) B

Ans: Option 3



Explanation:

Very first paragraph determines the tone which goes on to criticise the human activities against nature sarcastically yet issues a suggestive warning to exercise due foresight and self-control. Entire passage revolves around this tone and concludes with the suggestion not to disturb the ecological balance.



Directions for questions 16 to 20 - Read the short passage below and answer the questions that follow:



Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a Professor of Physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French university, where she earned her master's degree and doctorate in physics.



Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many productive years working together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.



Curie's feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.
