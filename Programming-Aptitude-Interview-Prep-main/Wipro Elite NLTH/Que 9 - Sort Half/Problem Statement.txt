Sort array ascending and descending order in java
In this article we will learn how to write a java program for sorting first half in ascending order and second half in descending order. Although it sounds a bit difficult but we’ll try to make it as easy as possible. Let’s take an example for understanding what we have to perform

Input array : [3, 5, 2, 7, 9, 1]
Output array : [1, 2, 3, 9, 7, 5]

Algorithm for Sorting first half in ascending order and second half in descending order (Sort array ascending and descending order)
Step 1 – Initialize a variable len, for accepting the length of the array.
Step 2 – Take the input from the user using a for loop.
Step 3 – Sort the inputted array in the ascending order.
Step 4 – Use two for loops for printing the array
Use the first loop from 0 to len/2 for printing the first ascending part of the array.
Use the second for loop from len-1 to len/2 for printing the second descending part of the array.
