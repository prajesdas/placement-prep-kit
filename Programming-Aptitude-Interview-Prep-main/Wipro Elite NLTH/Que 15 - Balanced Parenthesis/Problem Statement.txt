Balanced Parenthesis
To check balanced parenthesis is a basic interview question where we are asked to find whether the given string(of brackets) is balanced or not. To do this , the traditional way of doing is using stacks but we can also find by using normal programming techniques. Different brackets are  ( ) , [ ] , { }. Question can be asked on any type of bracket or of all types of brackets.

Sample input: ()(())
Sample output: True
Balanced Parenthesis in Java
Algorithm
Declare a character stack.
Now traverse the expression string exp. 
If the current character is a starting bracket (‘(‘ or ‘{‘ or ‘[‘) then push it to stack.
If the current character is a closing bracket (‘)’ or ‘}’ or ‘]’) then pop from stack and if the popped character is the matching starting bracket then fine else brackets are not balanced.
After complete traversal, if there is some starting bracket left in stack then “not balanced”
